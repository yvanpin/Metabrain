1)When saving for the first time the result of a segmentation, METABRAIN will create a CSV file where data will be appended at each saving.

2)This version create .npy files containing a segmentation matrix (1=edema, 0=other) for each edema segmented.
To work the software properly, please create an empty folder called « npy » in the folder you will save the data (inside the folder where the CSV will be created).

3)Input required is a list of dicom files containing a T1 (best in MPR) and a FLAIR sequence. The file containing RT structure set has to be in the same directory and its name has to start with « RTS » and have the extension « .dcm » .

4)To charge files of a patient, click « Open patient … », select the directory containing the files of the patient and click « open ». 1 patient = 1 directory.

Indicate first the MPR (or T1) by one click on the first list, then make the same in the second list for the FLAIR.
Wait until MRI slices are displayed.

5) To modify the pre segmentation mask windowing : click and slide SLOWLY (up-down, left-right)
When you release the left button, wait a few seconds to let the software pre segment the entire exam.

6) When ok, click « Launch segmentation ». Scroll a little bit down and wait colored segmentation appears.

7) It segmentation is good, click save and choose the output directory.
If it is wrong, close the software and repeat the operations.

8) Note that this version interpolates FLAIR in order to have the same slice thickness than the T1. To change this parameter, look at the code to change the interpolation from « FLAIR to MPR » to « MPR to FLAIR ».
